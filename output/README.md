Plot scripts for the output in the parent folder
------------------------------------------------

- Execute the plot_all bash script to plot all standard output.

```
$ bash plot_all.sh
```

- Each python plot script takes one input: the so-called "tag" of the data to plot.
  For example if you want to plot the temperature data in the temperature_gas_final.txt file you run

```  
$ python temperature.py final
```
