# The feautrier program takes the example data from the ray files as input
# and uses this to solve the Feautrier equation. The results are stored in
# the intens data files.

# NOTE: To read the output files in C one needs to denote powers of ten with
# E instead of D. To do this one can execute this file as a bash script.
