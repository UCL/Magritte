@article{3DPDR,
abstract = {Photodissociation regions (PDRs) define the transition zone between an ionized and a dark molecular region. They consist of neutral gas which interacts with far-ultraviolet radiation and are characterized by strong infrared line emission. Various numerical codes treating one-dimensional PDRs have been developed in the past, simulating the complexity of chemical reactions occurring and providing a better understanding of the structure of a PDR. In this paper we present the three-dimensional code, 3D-PDR, which can treat PDRs of arbitrary density distribution. The code solves the chemistry and the thermal balance self-consistently within a given three-dimensional cloud. It calculates the total heating and cooling functions at any point in a given PDR by adopting an escape probability method. It uses a HEALPix-based ray-tracing scheme to evaluate the attenuation of the far-ultraviolet radiation in the PDR and the propagation of the far-infrared/submm line emission out of the PDR. We present benchmarking results and apply 3D-PDR to i) a uniform-density spherical cloud interacting with a plane-parallel external radiation field, ii) a uniform-density spherical cloud interacting with a two-component external radiation field, and iii) a cometary globule interacting with a plane-parallel external radiation field. We find that the code is able to reproduce the benchmarking results of various other one-dimensional numerical codes treating PDRs. We also find that the accurate treatment of the radiation field in the fully three-dimensional treatment of PDRs can in some cases leads to different results when compared to a standard one-dimensional treatment.},

abstract = {The most abundant interstellar molecule, H2, is generally thought to form by recombination of H atoms on grain surfaces. On surfaces, hydrogen atoms can be physisorbed and chemisorbed and their mobility can be governed by quantum mechanical tunneling or thermal hopping. We have developed a model for molecular hydrogen formation on surfaces. This model solves the time-dependent kinetic rate equation for atomic and molecular hydrogen and their isotopes, taking the presence of physisorbed and chemisorbed sites, as well as quantum mechanical diffusion and thermal hopping, into account. The results show that the time evolution of this system is mainly governed by the binding energies and barriers against migration of the adsorbed species. We have compared the results of our model with experiments on the formation of HD on silicate and carbonaceous surfaces under irradiation by atomic H and D beams at low and at high temperatures. This comparison shows that including both isotopes, both physisorbed and chemisorbed wells, and both quantum mechanical tunneling and thermal hopping is essential for a correct interpretation of the experiments. This comparison allows us to derive the characteristics of these surfaces. For the two surfaces we consider, we determine the binding energy of H atoms and H2 molecules, as well as the barrier against diffusion for the H atoms to move from one site to another. We conclude that molecular hydrogen formation is efficient until quite high (500 K) temperatures. At low temperatures, recombination between mobile physisorbed atoms and trapped chemisorbed atoms dominates. At higher temperatures, chemisorbed atoms become mobile, and this then drives molecular hydrogen formation. We have extended our model to astrophysically relevant conditions. The results show that molecular hydrogen formation proceeds with near unity efficiency at low temperatures (T 20 K). While the efficiency drops, molecular hydrogen formation in the ISM can be very efficient even at high temperatures, depending on the physical characteristics of the surface.},

abstract = {A theoretical parameter study of the temperature and chemical structure of dense photodissociation regions and their resultant spectrum is presented. Models are discussed which are relevant not only to the dust and gas between molecular clouds and H II regions, but also apply to any neutral cloud illuminated by intense FUV fluxes. The models relate observed line and continuum emission from these regions to physical parameters such as the gas density and temperature, the elemental and chemical abundances, the local radiation field, and the grain properties. The results are applied to observational data from the OMC-1 region. The model shows that the observed high brightness temperature of the C I 609 microns line can be explained by emission from the C(+)/C/CO transition region. This difference with previous chemical models is due to a higher gas phase elemental abundance of carbon, to the charge exchange reactions of C(+) with S and SiO, and to carbon self-shielding.},

abstract = {A new scheme for solving multi-level non-LTE radiative transfer problems is described. In this scheme the radiation field is related to the source function by an approximate radiative transfer operator. This operator is used to set up the linearized nonlocal statistical equilibrium equations for the population numbers with small amounts of computing time. These equations have a characteristic and simple structure which enable a fast solution. The approximate statistical equilibrium equations are combined with the exact rate equations such that the final solution always is exact. The basic methods described can handle velocity fields, partial redistribution, and complex geometries and are ideal for future applications to the numerical solution of radiative hydrodynamics problems with radiation transport in lines and continua The methods form the basis of a non-LTE program that is more general than the often used code LINEAR-B. Calculations made so far indicate that the new method also is more stable and faster by typically a factor of ten. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {We present a new code for solving the molecular and atomic excitation and radiation transfer problem in a molecular gas and predicting emergent spectra. This code works in arbitrary three dimensional geometry using unstructured Delaunay latices for the transport of photons. Various physical models can be used as input, ranging from analytical descriptions over tabulated models to SPH simulations. To generate the Delaunay grid we sample the input model randomly, but weigh the sample probability with the molecular density and other parameters, and thereby we obtain an average grid point separation that scales with the local opacity. Our code does photon very efficiently so that the slow convergence of opaque models becomes traceable. When convergence between the level populations, the radiation field, and the point separation has been obtained, the grid is ray-traced to produced images that can readily be compared to observations. Because of the high dynamic range in scales that can be resolved using this type of grid, our code is particularly well suited for modeling of ALMA data. Our code can furthermore deal with overlapping lines of multiple molecular and atomic species.},

abstract = {Far-infrared [C II] 158-m, [O I] 145-m and [O I] 63-m fine structure emission-line fluxes were measured from archival Infrared Space Observatory Long Wavelength Spectrometer spectra of 46 extragalactic sources, with 28 sources providing detections in all three lines. For 12 of the sources, the contribution to the [C II] 158-m line flux from H II regions could be estimated from their detected [N II] 122-m line fluxes. The measured [C II]/[O I] and [O I] 63/145-m line flux ratios were compared with those from a grid of photodissociation region (PDR) models previously computed using the UCL{\_}PDR code. Persistent offsets between the observed and modelled line ratios could be partly attributed to the effects of [O I] 63-m self-absorption. Using the Spherical Multi-Mol (SMMOL) code, we calculated model [O I] line profiles and found that the strength of the [O I] 63-m line was reduced by 20-80 per cent, depending on the PDR parameters. We conclude that high PDR densities and radiation field strengths, coupled with the effects of [O I] 63-m self-absorption, are likely to provide the best match to the observed line flux ratios.},

However, quantum physics — to which a major part is devoted — will be of more interest since, not only it applies to quantum plasma physics, but also to nuclear matter and to strong magnetic field, cosmology, etc. Although the domain of gauge theory is not covered in this book, the topic is not completely forgotten, in particular in the domain of plasma physics. This book is particularly readable for graduate students and a fortiori to young researchers for whom it offers methods and also appropriate schemes to deal with the current problems encountered in astrophysics, in strong magnetic, in nuclear or even in high energy physics.},

abstract = {Hawking radiation is often intuitively visualized as particles that have tunneled across the horizon. Yet, at first sight, it is not apparent where the barrier is. Here I show that the barrier depends on the tunneling particle itself. The key is to implement energy conservation, so that the black hole contracts during the process of radiation. A direct consequence is that the radiation spectrum cannot be strictly thermal. The correction to the thermal spectrum is of precisely the form that one would expect from an underlying unitary quantum theory. This may have profound implications for the black hole information puzzle.},

Firstly, the ionization fraction x{\_}e is approximately 10{\%} smaller for redshifts {\textless}{\~{}}800, due to non-equilibrium processes in the excited states of H. Secondly, HeI recombination is much slower than previously thought, and is delayed until just before H recombines. We describe the basic physics behind the new results and present a simple way to reproduce our calculation. This should enable fast computation of the ionization history (and quantities such as the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies which depend on it) for arbitrary cosmologies, without the need to consider the hundreds of atomic levels used in our complete model.},

In particular, in theories with symmetry breaking, the renormalized entanglement entropy saturates for large entangling regions to values that are controlled by the symmetry breaking parameters.},

Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this field.},

abstract = {Context. Dust reprocesses about half of the stellar radiation in galaxies. The thermal re-emission by dust of absorbed energy is considered to be driven merely by young stars so is often applied to tracing the star formation rate in galaxies. Recent studies have argued that the old stellar population might be responsible for a non-negligible fraction of the radiative dust heating. Aims: In this work, we aim to analyze the contribution of young (≲100 Myr) and old ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}10 Gyr) stellar populations to radiative dust heating processes in the nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M 51 using radiative transfer modeling. High-resolution 3D radiative transfer (RT) models are required to describe the complex morphologies of asymmetric spiral arms and clumpy star-forming regions and to model the propagation of light through a dusty medium. Methods: In this paper, we present a new technique developed to model the radiative transfer effects in nearby face-on galaxies. We construct a high-resolution 3D radiative transfer model with the Monte-Carlo code SKIRT to account for the absorption, scattering, and non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) emission of dust in M 51. The 3D distribution of stars is derived from the 2D morphology observed in the IRAC 3.6 {\$}\mu{\$}m, GALEX FUV, H{\$}\alpha{\$}, and MIPS 24 {\$}\mu{\$}m wavebands, assuming an exponential vertical distribution with an appropriate scale height. The dust geometry is constrained through the far-ultraviolet (FUV) attenuation, which is derived from the observed total-infrared-to-far-ultraviolet luminosity ratio. The stellar luminosity, star formation rate, and dust mass have been scaled to reproduce the observed stellar spectral energy distribution (SED), FUV attenuation, and infrared SED. Results: The dust emission derived from RT calculations is consistent with far-infrared and submillimeter observations of M 51, implying that the absorbed stellar energy is balanced by the thermal re-emission of dust. The young stars provide 63{\{}{\%}{\}} of the energy for heating the dust responsible for the total infrared emission (8-1000 {\$}\mu{\$}m), while 37{\{}{\%}{\}} of the dust emission is governed through heating by the evolved stellar population. In individual wavebands, the contribution from young stars to the dust heating dominates at all infrared wavebands but gradually decreases towards longer infrared and submillimeter wavebands for which the old stellar population becomes a non-negligible source of heating. Upon extrapolation of the results for M 51, we present prescriptions for estimating the contribution of young stars to the global dust heating based on a tight correlation between the dust heating fraction and specific star formation rate.

abstract = {We present a new code for solving the molecular and atomic excitation and radiation transfer problem in a molecular gas and predicting emergent spectra. This code works in arbitrary three dimensional geometry using unstructured Delaunay latices for the transport of photons. Various physical models can be used as input, ranging from analytical descriptions over tabulated models to SPH simulations. To generate the Delaunay grid we sample the input model randomly, but weigh the sample probability with the molecular density and other parameters, and thereby we obtain an average grid point separation that scales with the local opacity. Our code does photon very efficiently so that the slow convergence of opaque models becomes traceable. When convergence between the level populations, the radiation field, and the point separation has been obtained, the grid is ray-traced to produced images that can readily be compared to observations. Because of the high dynamic range in scales that can be resolved using this type of grid, our code is particularly well suited for modeling of ALMA data. Our code can furthermore deal with overlapping lines of multiple molecular and atomic species.},

Models are discussed which are relevant not only to the dust and gas between molecular clouds and H II regions, but also apply to any neutral cloud illuminated by intense FUV fluxes. The models relate observed line and continuum emission from these regions to physical parameters such as the gas density and temperature, the elemental and chemical abundances, the local radiation field, and the grain properties. The results are applied to observational data from the OMC-1 region. The model shows that the observed high brightness temperature of the C I 609 microns line can be explained by emission from the C(+)/C/CO transition region. This difference with previous chemical models is due to a higher gas phase elemental abundance of carbon, to the charge exchange reactions of C(+) with S and SiO, and to carbon self-shielding.},

In this scheme the radiation field is related to the source function by an approximate radiative transfer operator. This operator is used to set up the linearized nonlocal statistical equilibrium equations for the population numbers with small amounts of computing time. These equations have a characteristic and simple structure which enable a fast solution. The approximate statistical equilibrium equations are combined with the exact rate equations such that the final solution always is exact. The basic methods described can handle velocity fields, partial redistribution, and complex geometries and are ideal for future applications to the numerical solution of radiative hydrodynamics problems with radiation transport in lines and continua The methods form the basis of a non-LTE program that is more general than the often used code LINEAR-B. Calculations made so far indicate that the new method also is more stable and faster by typically a factor of ten. ?? 1985.},
